    # When we have updated static libraries in competition with older

    # and will pull in the entire archive to the binary giving it 
    # priority in symbol resolution.  Beware of cmake moving the
    # achive load itself to another place on the link command line.  If
    # that happens, you can try something like -Wl,-lpng16 here to hide
    # the archive.  Also be aware that the linker will not tolerate a
    # second whole-archive load of the archive.  See viewer's
    # CMakeLists.txt for more information.
